# RL_Maze_Generator_and-Solver

## Description
This project is a Maze generator and solver. For the generation of the maze we have used a maze generation algorithm and for training the agent we have used reinforcement learning.

## Tech Stack
The preferred operating system is Linux, the front-end uses GTK and the back-end is written in Python. Therefore the tech stack can be LGP. There are also no api's used.

## Installation
Step1 : git clone https://github.com/RakshithRAcharya/RL_Maze_Generator_and-Solver.git

Step2 : sudo apt install python3-gi python3-gi-cairo gir1. 2-gtk-3.0.

Step3 : cd RL_Maze_Generator_and-Solver/

Step4 : python3 Maze_Solve.py
